What is Carina?
Founded in 2016, Carina is a technology nonprofit that provides a safe, easy-to-use, online location-based care matching service. We serve individuals and families who are in need of care, either in-home services or child care, and care professionals who are looking for good jobs. Carina is committed to building community and prioritizing people over profit. Through our partnerships with unions and social service agencies, we make sure our care providers make union wages and have access to benefits, so they can focus on their passion â€” caring for others.
Our vision is a care economy that strengthens our communities by respecting and supporting workers, individuals, and families. We offer a care matching platform where verified care providers can connect with individuals and families that need care.

How does Carina work?
Individual Providers (IPs) throughout Washington are welcome to register on Carina, create profiles to showcase their availability and skills and browse and respond to jobs. IPs who are Adult Child Providers or Parent Providers can also post jobs for relief and backup care (if they have the legal authority to act on behalf of their consumer) and have other IPs respond to them directly.
Consumers receiving Medicaid-funded or state-funded in-home care are welcome to post jobs, browse care provider profiles and contact care providers. Consumer Direct Care Network Washington (CDWA) coordinators can also post jobs on behalf of consumers. Once the consumer and care provider have determined they would like to work together, the consumer should contact CDWA for review and authorization. All matches need to be authorized by CDWA before payment can begin.
